# interactive-web-applications

Interactive web applications for data visualization which I developed during my time at Fraunhofer IWES. These were created using Python libraries such as Streamlit and Dash. 

- This repository contains images and videos of these apps (videos must be downloaded to see).

- It also contains a link for a simple app created for the Torque 2024 conference using Streamlit. It uses the Fraunhofer Web Application Farm, which is Fraunhofer's own hosting platform with web applications like Streamlit and Dash.
